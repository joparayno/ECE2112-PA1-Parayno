# PA1-PARAYNO

Uploaded in this Repo is my PA1 for the Introduction to Python Programming. Experiment 1 is about identifying the basic codes and functions in Python Programming.

We we're given 3 different problems in Experiment 1:

1st Problem is Alphabet Soup Problem which indicates to create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order.

# The code that I made asks the user to enter a word, then rearranges the letters of that word in alphabetical order, ignoring whether the letters are uppercase or lowercase. It removes any extra spaces, sorts the letters, and then displays the sorted word as the output.

2nd Problem is Emoticon problem in which to Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad and mad with their corresponding emoticon. 

# The code that I made defines a function emotify that replaces specific words in a user's input sentence with corresponding emoticons. The function splits the sentence into words, checks each word against a dictionary of predefined words and their associated emoticons, and replaces any matching words with the corresponding emoticons. The modified sentence is then printed as the output.

3rd Problem is Unpacking List Problem in which the student has to unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then print all three variables.

# The code that I made takes a list of numbers from 1 to 6 and splits it into three parts. The first number in the list (1) is saved as "First," the numbers in between (2, 3, 4, 5) are saved as "Middle," and the last number (6) is saved as "Last." The code then prints out these three parts separately.
